% 2015-1-12 / Enzo Mastinu / Divided the RecordingSession function into
                            % several functions: ConnectDevice(),
                            % SetDeviceStartAcquisition(),
                            % Acquire_tWs(), StopAcquisition(). This functions 
                            % has been moved to COMM/AFE folder, into this new script.

% 2015-12-4 / Ricardo Garcia / Added compatibility for Quaser Boards.
